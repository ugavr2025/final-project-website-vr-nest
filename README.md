Eshaan Patel Bio

Hi! I am a senior CS major. I was born in New York, but moved down to Alpharetta, Georgia in 2015. Currently I am enjoying this vr class a lot. I have unity experience, however I have never worked with vr games before, so in a lot of ways this is a very new experience




Project Description:

Create a Museum with multiple exhibits. In each exhibit, the player learns about it via an NPC. On the way to each exhibit, there will be multiplayer challenges such as a puzzle or
parkour to complete, each puzzle incorporating the theme of the next exhibit.

Hi! I am a senior CS major. I was born in New York, but moved down to Alpharetta, Georgia in 2015. Currently I am enjoying this vr class a lot. I have unity experience, however I have never worked with vr games before, so in a lot of ways this is a very new experience. Looking forward to the next of the semester!
